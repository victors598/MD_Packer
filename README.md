# MD_Packer
Code developed for Motion Design interview test

There is a Makefile that will build all of the relevant .java files necessary to make this system work.
To build the system, in terminal, go to the MD_Packer directory and type into the terminal "make"
To run the system, in terminal from within the MD_Packer directory, type in "make run".

If you use make run, then the hardcoded file name of the inputs needs to be updated in the 
runner.java file. 

However, you can also run the system from the terminal using this command:
	$java runner <your-file-name>
